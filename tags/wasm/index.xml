      <description>Attacks on software repositories happen all the time, and any future WebAssembly repository and client tooling should be prepared to mitigate these attacks. In this article we will explore a minimum security model for WebAssembly registries and client tooling based on The Update Framework, and how to integrate this model when distributing WebAssembly modules using OCI registries.</description>

      <description>WebAssembly (WASM) is a binary instruction format for a stack-based virtual machine. In familiar terms, WASM is used as a compilation target for various programming languages (C, C++, Rust, or Golang, for example), generating a compact binary with a known format. Mozilla Developer Network describes WebAssembly as having huge implications for the web platform — it provides a way to run code written in multiple languages on the web at near native speed, with client apps running on the web that previously couldn’t have done so.</description>

      <title>Rendering Helm templates in the browser, with Web Assembly</title>

      <description>I&#39;ve been trying to find a weekend to play around with Web Assembly for at least a couple of months now - I had previously read the hello world examples for both Go and Rust, but never had the time to actually try things out. So I decided to take a piece of real world Go code, that is used today in Helm, and see if I can get it to execute in the browser - I chose to replicate a simpler version of helm template, where you input the template, values file, and metadata in the web page, and the rendered template gets printed out.</description>
