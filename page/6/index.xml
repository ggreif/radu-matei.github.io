      <title>Rendering Helm templates in the browser, with WebAssembly</title>
      <link>https://radu-matei.com/blog/helm-wasm/</link>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been trying to find a weekend to play around with Web Assembly for at least a couple of months now - I had previously read the hello world examples for both Go and Rust, but never had the time to actually try things out. So I decided to take a piece of real world Go code, that is used today in Helm, and see if I can get it to execute in the browser - I chose to replicate a simpler version of helm template, where you input the template, values file, and metadata in the web page, and the rendered template gets printed out.</description>

      <title>Instant Scaling on Demand: Serverless Kubernetes with Brigade</title>

      <description>This article originally appeared on the Microsoft open source blog .
Microservices built on Kubernetes are fast becoming one of the core scenarios where computing is done, and Kubernetes development and operations skills are therefore becoming a larger part of any cloud-native toolset. This article shows how to use some of the Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF) and CNCF sandbox projects together to build a Kubernetes-native application that listens for events and then runs serverless pipelines on Virtual Kubelet instances, each of which are dynamically created (and recycled when the pipeline is done).</description>

      <title>Filter secrets from Kubernetes logs</title>

      <description>Running any non-trivial application on Kubernetes will most likely require authorized access to other components - databases, storage buckets, APIs - all of which require a connection string or some sort of access key. Storing these values in Kubernetes is done through Secrets , and while there are plenty of ways to make sure the secrets are safe while at rest , as well as how to configure an external KMS provider , once the secret is injected into your application container, its value will be plain text.</description>
