      <title>Inject ASP.NET Core Dependencies from JSON files</title>

      <description>Back in the days of ASP.NET 4.x, each of the framework components - MVC, WebAPI, OWIN, SignalR - had its own dependency resolver and its own way of integrating with the framework. ASP.NET Core brings a consistent dependency injection mechanism with a unified meaning for lifetime or service registration,that is designed to server the needs of the framework and most consumer applications built on it. In this article, we will see a way of defining the service types and the implementation types we want to use based on a JSON file and switch between implementations without changing the code.</description>

      <title>Introduction to ASP .NET Core MVC API</title>

      <description>In this article we will be looking at ASP .NET Core MVC, more specifically at how to build an API that can be consumed from any type of application, be it web, mobile or desktop. We will build a very simple application that will enable the creation of posts (much like messages) and that will take us through adding the MVC services, creating models, controllers and consuming some data.</description>

      <title>ASP .NET Core JSON Configuration and Dependency Injection</title>
      <link>https://radu-matei.com/blog/aspnet-core-configuration-greeting/</link>

      <description>The new configuration system provides support for JSON, XML, INI and for in-memory configuration, while also allowing you to create your custom configuration provider. Let&amp;rsquo;s assume that in our application we want the response messages not to be hard-coded in Startup anymore, but stored in a configuration file so we don&amp;rsquo;t have to stop, modify or recompile our application every time the messages or the routes change.</description>

      <title>ASP .NET Core Routing</title>

      <description>So far we built simple web applications that responded with the same message for each request. However, any real-world application is going to need a more complex way of handling requests, so in this article we will see how to create route handlers for specific routes and how to extract parameters from the request URI - we will explore the low-level Routing API.</description>

      <title>ASP .NET Core Startup</title>

      <description>Any non-trivial application is going to need a mechanism to handle different types of requests and map them to specific services and middleware and configure services. This is accomplished through the &lt;code&gt;Startup&lt;/code&gt; class, which is also the entry point for any incoming HTTP request.</description>
