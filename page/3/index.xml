      <title>Rendering Helm templates in the browser, with Web Assembly</title>

      <description>I&#39;ve been trying to find a weekend to play around with Web Assembly for at least a couple of months now - I had previously read the hello world examples for both Go and Rust, but never had the time to actually try things out. So I decided to take a piece of real world Go code, that is used today in Helm, and see if I can get it to execute in the browser - I chose to replicate a simpler version of helm template, where you input the template, values file, and metadata in the web page, and the rendered template gets printed out.</description>

      <title>Filter secrets from Kubernetes logs</title>

      <description>Running any non-trivial application on Kubernetes will most likely require authorized access to other components - databases, storage buckets, APIs - all of which require a connection string or some sort of access key. Storing these values in Kubernetes is done through Secrets, and while there are plenty of ways to make sure the secrets are safe while at rest, as well as how to configure an external KMS provider, once the secret is injected into your application container, its value will be plain text.</description>

      <title>The state of debugging microservices on Kubernetes</title>

      <description>For as long as we have been writing software, we have also introduced bugs in our applications. Back when we were developing monoliths, we could simply start the IDE of choice, add a couple of breakpoints, step through the code and hopefully solve the issue. There was a single place where the application was running, where logs were visible and where the application could be diagnosed.</description>
