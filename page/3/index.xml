      <title>Building self-contained, single executable .NET Core 3 CLI tools</title>

      <description>GitHub Actions now supports CI/CD - and while the workers for Actions come pre-configured with support for lots of programming languages and frameworks, you have the option to use an existing action to configure the environment, or build your own.
