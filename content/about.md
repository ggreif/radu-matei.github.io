Who am I?
=========

Hi, and thanks for the visit! I'm an open source software developer and [I sometimes speak to user groups, meetups and conferences](/speaking).
I'm really passionate about **containers, orchestrators, serverless computing, *continuous everything* and the cloud**.

I like to see myself as a *"friendly geek who accelerates developers to build epic stuff"* and work as Software Engineer in the Microsoft Azure Containers Team, building Kubernetes, containers and cloud native open source developer tools.

In the past I was a Technical Evangelist and helped software development companies architect, develop and scale their solutions in the cloud.

I also like to engage with the local startup ecosystem - this way, I've been a technical mentor in a few Romanian accelerators and pre-accelerators and helped founders scale their products with the cloud, and think teaching children about computers and programming is important, [and enjoy participating in Hour of Code](http://www.techsoupeurope.org/hour-of-code-2016-with-asociatia-techsoup-and-microsoft-romania/) events.


If you're in Bucharest, Romania, be sure to check the [Bucharest Container Meetup](https://www.meetup.com/Bucharest-Container-Meetup/) for events - and if you want to speak here, [just ping me](/contact) :)

What is this blog about?
========================

This is the place I sometimes write about projects I'm working on - it is mostly about containers, orchestrators, serverless, Go, .NET Core and the cloud.
Please keep in mind that *the views and opinions presented here are my own and are not affiliated with any organization I am part of.*


What am I working on?
=====================

I'm always working on fun little projects, so [check out my GitHub profile](https://github.com/radu-matei).

That being said, I've worked on things like a [websocket manager for .NET Core](https://github.com/radu-matei/websocket-manager), adding support for [LinuxKit on Azure](https://github.com/linuxkit/linuxkit), adding native [Go in Azure Functions](https://github.com/radu-matei/azure-functions-golang-worker) and I frequently contribute to open source developer tooling for Kubernetes such as [Draft](https://github.com/Azure/draft) and the [VS Code Kubernetes extension](https://github.com/Azure/vscode-kubernetes-tools).
