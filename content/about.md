Who am I?
=========

Hi, and thanks for the visit! I'm an open-source software developer, teacher and [sometimes I speak to user groups, meetups and conferences](/speaking).
I'm really passionate about containers, orchestrators, serverless computing, *continuous everything* and the cloud.

I also like to engage with the local startup ecosystem - this way, I've been a technical mentor in an awesome startup pre-accelerator program, [Innovation Labs](https://www.innovationlabs.ro/mentors), and have been working with Romanian accelerators and startups on scaling their products with the cloud (through the Microsoft BizSpark programs). 

I love going to hackathons, hackests or codefests and [sometimes I have the chance to be in the jury](http://2017.techsylvania.co/hackathon/coaches-judges/) :)

Before joining Microsoft I had the great opportunity to teach students C#, web development and cloud technologies and the chance to mentor Microsoft Student Partners - so I really enjoy teaching and explaining tech stuff. 

I really, really think teaching children about computers and programming is important, [and enjoy participating in Hour of Code](http://www.techsoupeurope.org/hour-of-code-2016-with-asociatia-techsoup-and-microsoft-romania/) events.

I like to see myself as a **"friendly geek who accelerates developers to build epic stuff"** and work as a @Microsoft Technical Evangelist in Central and Eastern Europe - essentially, I work with software development companies and help them architect, develop and scale their software using the cloud - I've worked with huge companies and migrated entire datacenters with hundreds of VMs to the cloud  and I've worked with [pizza-sized startups](http://www.businessinsider.com/jeff-bezos-two-pizza-rule-for-productive-meetings-2013-10) and helped them optimize their workloads and their CI/CD pipeline.
While I usually work with a wide range of technologies on a daily basis, I enjoy the most working with containers, orchestrators, write serverless functions and continuosly deploy everything.

If you're in Bucharest, Romania, be sure to check the [Bucharest Container Meetup](https://www.meetup.com/Bucharest-Container-Meetup/) for events - and if you want to speak here, [just say the word](/contact) :)

What is this blog about?
========================

This is the place I sometimes write about projects I'm working on - it is mostly about containers, orchestrators, serverless, Go, .NET Core and the cloud.
Please keep in mind that *the views and opinions presented here are my own and are not affiliated with any organization I am part of.*


What am I working on?
=====================

I'm always trying to find time for fun side projects, and most of the time I find myself having to choose what to work on - for an accurate response to the question *what I am working on*, [please check out my GitHub profile](https://github.com/radu-matei).

That being said, I've worked on things like a [websocket manager for .NET Core](https://github.com/radu-matei/websocket-manager), adding support for [LinuxKit on Azure](https://github.com/linuxkit/linuxkit), adding native [Go in Azure Functions](https://github.com/radu-matei/azure-functions-golang-worker) and a bunch more.
