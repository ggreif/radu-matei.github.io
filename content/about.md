Who am I?
=========

I'm an open source software engineer who [sometimes speaks at conferences and organizes technical workshops.](/speaking)
I'm passionate about open source software, containers and Kubernetes, serverless and the cloud, and I'm a friendly geek who works as a software engineer in the Microsoft Azure Cloud Native team, building Kubernetes and cloud native developer tools.

I absolutely love music (and occasionally play my guitar and piano), and enjoy a good bicycle ride.

I used to work as a technical evangelist and helped startups and software development companies architect, develop and scale their solutions using cloud native technologies.

What is this blog about?
========================

This is the place I'll write about stuff I'm working on - this includes (but is not limited to): containers, Kubernetes, Go, serverless.
Obviously, *the views and opinions presented here are my own and are not affiliated with any organization I am part of.*
