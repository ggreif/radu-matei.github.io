My name is Radu Matei, I'm an Automatic Control & Computer Science student from Bucharest, Romania, studying at the “Politehnica” University of Bucharest.

I'm a Microsoft Technical Evangelist Intern and I've been a Microsoft Student Partner since my junior year.

What is this blog about?
========================

This blog is about software development, mostly .NET, with Cloud, IoT and micro-services.
I also enjoy giving technical presentations, so I will keep a record of the ones I've given.

The views presented here are my own and are not affiliated with any organization I am part of.
