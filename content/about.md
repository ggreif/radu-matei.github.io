Hi, I'm Radu!

I'm an open source software engineer who [sometimes speaks at conferences and organizes technical workshops.](/speaking)
I'm passionate about open source software, containers and Kubernetes, serverless and the cloud, and I'm a friendly geek who works as a software engineer in the Microsoft Azure Cloud Native team, building Kubernetes and cloud native developer tools for distributed systems.
I used to work as a cloud engineer at Microsoft, and helped startups and software development companies architect, develop, and scale their solutions using cloud native technologies.

I absolutely love music (and really excited about learning to play the piano), and enjoy a good bicycle ride.

This is the place I'll write about stuff I'm working on - this includes (but is not limited to): containers, Kubernetes, Go, Rust, or WebAssembly. Sometimes I also write about non-technical topics - you can find all of them under the [#personal](/tags/personal/) tag.

If you need to, you can find me on the Internet:
