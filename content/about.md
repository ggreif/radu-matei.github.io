Who am I?
=========

I'm a container enthusiast and open-source software developer. I like to see myself as a "friendly geek who accelerates developers to build epic stuff", working as a Technical Evangelist @Microsoft. 

I am also the organizer of the [Bucharest Container Meetup](https://www.meetup.com/Bucharest-Container-Meetup/), so if you are anytime in Bucharest, Romania, be sure to check for events.

What is this blog about?
========================

This blog is about containers, orchestrators, .NET Core and others.
I enjoy speaking at confrences and meetups. You can [find my upcoming sesisons in the Speaking section](/speaking).
