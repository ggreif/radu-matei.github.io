Hi!
===
Thanks for wanting to get in contact with me!
I usually respond to all valid requests and questions and below you can find the ways to do it:

[Email: radu@radu-matei.com](mailto:radu@radu-matei.com)
--------------------------------------------------------
This is the easiest way to get in contact with me - keep in mind, this is my personal email, so please don't spam :)

However, if you have an issue, bug or request on an article or project, also consider commenting on the article or GitHub (see below).

[GitHub: radu-matei](https://github.com/radu-matei)
--------------------------------------------------
If you're working with a project, or want to contribute to one, please consider raising an issue or pull-request on the respective repo on GitHub - this way, your contribution is already on the project and someone might start working on it.

Twitter is the social platform I use the most, so there you'll probably find the things I'm working on and haven't had a change to write a blog post about. Keep in mind that opinions are my own!
