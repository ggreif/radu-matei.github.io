      <description>Introduction If you want to interact with the Kubernetes cluster API, the most obvious choice for the programming language is Go. Since Kubernetes itself is written in Go, it naturally became the de facto language for interacting with the API, and writing controllers is no exception.
You even have multiple choices for writing a Go controller - you can directly use the Go client, and follow the implementation of this controller sample, or you can use Kubebuilder, Metacontroller, or the awesome operator-sdk, all of which give you a starting point for creating controllers that interact with custom resources.</description>
