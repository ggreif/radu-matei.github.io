      <description>Back in the days of ASP.NET 4.x, each of the framework components - MVC, WebAPI, OWIN, SignalR - had its own dependency resolver and its own way of integrating with the framework. ASP.NET Core brings a consistent dependency injection mechanism with a unified meaning for lifetime or service registration,that is designed to server the needs of the framework and most consumer applications built on it. In this article, we will see a way of defining the service types and the implementation types we want to use based on a JSON file and switch between implementations without changing the code.</description>

We will build a very simple application that will enable the creation of posts (much like messages) and that will take us through adding the MVC services, creating models, controllers and consuming some data.</description>

      <title>ASP .NET Core JSON Configuration and Dependency Injection</title>

      <description>The new configuration system provides support for JSON, XML, INI and for in-memory configuration, while also allowing you to create your custom configuration provider. Let&amp;rsquo;s assume that in our application we want the response messages not to be hardcoded in Startup anymore, but stored in a configuration file so we don&amp;rsquo;t have to stop, modify or recompile our application every time the messages or the routes change.</description>
